It's like putting a special lock on your Wi-Fi network.
•	Only people who have the right key (like a special password) can unlock it and join your Wi-Fi.
•	It's an older way of protecting your Wi-Fi, like using a chain lock on a door. It works, but it's not as strong as newer locks.

WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) was once a common security protocol for Wi-Fi networks, aiming to provide encryption similar to wired networks. 

However, it's important to know that WEP is outdated and considered insecure due to several vulnerabilities.

What is WEP?

•	WEP uses RC4 stream cipher for data encryption and a static key for authentication.
•	It supports two key lengths: 40-bit and 128-bit (128-bit is more secure but less compatible with older devices).
•	Requires manually configuring the same key on both the router and any device connecting to the network.

WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) is an outdated and insecure wireless security protocol is highly vulnerable to security breaches, and it is strongly recommended to use more secure protocols like WPA2 or WPA3 if your devices support them.
