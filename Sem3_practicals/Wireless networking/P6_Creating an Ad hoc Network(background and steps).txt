Theory:-
Creating an ad-hoc network, also known as a peer-to-peer network, allows devices to connect directly to each other without the need for a central wireless access point.
Sure, let's simplify the concept of "Creating an Ad hoc Network":

1. Ad hoc Network:
   - An "Ad hoc Network" is like a temporary connection between devices. 
   - It's not a permanent setup but something created on the spot for a specific need.

2. Creating:
   - "Creating" here means making or setting up. 
   - So, we're talking about making a temporary connection between devices.

3. Putting it Together:
   - "Creating an Ad hoc Network" is like making a quick and temporary network between your devices when you need them to talk to each other directly, without needing a central router or internet connection.

In simpler terms, it's like making a short-term connection between your devices when you want them to share information directly without going through the usual internet or Wi-Fi setup. 
Imagine it as a direct link between your devices for a specific task.
Practical 6: Creating an Ad hoc Network.

1.Click on Network Devices → Click on Wireless Devices → Take 2 WRT300N wireless Routers (WRT300N Wireless Router0, WRT300N Wireless Router1)

2.Connection: -
Click on connection choose copper cross-over wire.
Connect Wireless Router0 Ethernet 1 → Wireless Router1 Ethernet1

3.Click on Wireless Router0 GUI  Click on Wireless
Network Name (SSID): CS

4. Click on Wireless Router0 → GUI Click on Wireless security→
Security Mode: WPA2 Personal
Passphrase: ciscorouter1
click on Save settings

5. Click on Wireless Router0 → GUI click on Administration.
Remote Access: Remote Management:  Enabled (Click on Enabled.)
click on Save settings.

6. Similarly do same thing on Wireless Router1.
Click on Wireless Router1GUIWireless → Basic Wireless settings.
Network Name (SSID): IT

7. Click on Wireless Router1 GUI Click on Wireless security→
Security Mode: WPA2 personal
Passpharse: ciscorouter2
Click on Save Settings.

8. Click on Wireless Router1 GUI Click on Administration.
Remote Access: Remote Management:  Enabled (Click on Enabled.)
click on Save settings.

9. Check both wireless routers connected with each other or not by dropping PDU.

10. Click m End devices → Take 5 PC-PT 
(PC-PT) PC0, PC1, PC2, PC3, PC4.
Connect machines (PC's) with wireless routers.

11. Click on PC-PT PC0 power off remove wired component & attach wireless component power on button.
Similarly, repeat this step for rest 4 machinesPC1, PC2, PC3, PC4.
Now all PC’s have wireless devices.

11. PC0 Desktop → PC wireless  Click on connect  Click on Refresh 
get 2 wireless network Name: CS,IT
Click on CS: Preshared key ciscorouter1click on connect.

12. PC1→ Desktop PC wireless  Click on Connect  Click on Refresh.
Click on IT: Preshared key ciscorouter2click on connect.

13. PC2→ Desktop PC wireless  Click on Connect  Click on Refresh.
Click on CS: Preshared key ciscorouter1click on connect.

14. PC3→ Desktop PC wireless  Click on Connect  Click on Refresh.
Click on CS: Preshared key ciscorouter1click on connect.

15. PC4→ Desktop PC wireless  Click on Connect  Click on Refresh.
Click on IT: Preshared key ciscorouter2click on connect.

16. Wireless Router0 Lable CS 
Wireless Router1 Lable IT 

17. Drop PDU. Check interconnectivity & Connectivity between routers.
