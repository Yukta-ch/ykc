background information:

Pivoting data refers to the process ofreorganizing and reshaping data to analyze it from adifferent perspective.
This transformation is often necessary to make the data more suitable for analysis, reporting, or visualization. 
The specific steps involved in pivoting data may vary depending on the tools or programming languages used, but the general idea is to convert
data from a long format to a wide formnat or vice versa. Herc arc two common types of data pivoting:

1. Wide to Long (Unpivoting):
This type of pivoting involves transforming wide-format data into along-format.

2. Long to Wide (Pivoting):
This type of pivoting involves transforming long-format data into a wide-format.
